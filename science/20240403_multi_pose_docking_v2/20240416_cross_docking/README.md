Ok now for cross-docking.

It works, although the results don't actually get saved well. This generated several issues on the asapdiscovery repo:
https://github.com/choderalab/asapdiscovery/issues/988

https://github.com/choderalab/asapdiscovery/issues/989

https://github.com/choderalab/asapdiscovery/issues/990

Need to make some code updates before continuing. I don't think I noticed the issue in self docking because I was always getting some results, so I didn't get any of the `None` errors.
