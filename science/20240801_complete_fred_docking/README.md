In order to compare the results we get from referenced-based docking to a more typical docking approach, I'd like to run complete cross-docking with FRED.


Notes:
I had to re-prep the fragalysis download because only 157 of the structures were getting recognized, it still won't recognize these three structures as being part of the cache:
`{'Mpro-P0053_0A', 'Mpro-P0091_0A', 'Mpro-P2007_0A'}`
