The purpose of this experiment is to test the new multi-reference docking functionality within the asapdiscovery repo and compare the default POSIT multi receptor docking to the existing protocols.

Each ligand will only have 1 docked pose, so at first I'll only be able to calculate a single value. I could re-run docking with *all* structures.
