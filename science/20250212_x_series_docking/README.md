# Goal
Since a lot of the chemical diversity is lost by only considering the p-series structures I want to run fred-only and full posit docking of the p-series ligands to the x-series structures.

# Todo
- [ ] filter out x-series structures that are actually bound to active site
- [] prep x-series structures
- [ ] filter again to make sure the ligands are in the active site and make sense
- [ ] run FRED docking
- [ ] run full POSIT docking
- [ ] analyze
