# Log
The goal for this directory is to re-run docking using hybrid-only docking.

## make_P-only_Mpro_combined_labled_sdf.ipynb
One thing to note is that I'm just gonna run on the P-series structures

I started this using the run_fragalysis_retrospective.sh script

but I'd like to split up the sdfs and run as a molecule array


## split_sdf.sh

## run_fragalysis_retrospective_array.sh

Ran first on 20230607 - forgot to add the hybrid flag.

## 20230608
rerunning with hybrid flag
